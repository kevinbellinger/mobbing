        To gain entry into CHC51712 Diploma of Counselling it is recommended that you have sufficient relevant work experience to indicate likely success at this level of qualification in a job role, involving:<br><br>
• The self-directed application of knowledge with substantial depth in some areas.<br>
• The exercise of independent judgement and decision-making.<br>
• The application of relevant technical and other skills.<br><br>
As part of your enrolment application you will be required to complete a questionnaire to assess the above points as well as your personal maturity and suitability to become a counsellor.<br>
Part of this questionnaire includes a Language, Literacy and Numeracy (LLN) quiz that will help us to determine the level of support that we will need to provide you through your course.

• The self-directed application of knowledge with substantial depth in some areas.<br>
• The exercise of independent judgement and decision-making.<br>
• The application of relevant technical and other skills.<br><br>
As part of your enrolment application you will be required to complete a questionnaire to assess the above points as well as your personal maturity and suitability to become a counsellor.<br>
Part of this questionnaire includes a Language, Literacy and Numeracy (LLN) quiz that will help us to determine the level of support that we will need to provide you through your course.
